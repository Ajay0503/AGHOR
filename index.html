        <h1>Manufacturing</h1>
        <p>Manufacturing clothing and accessories for AGHOR typically involves several stages, including designing, sourcing materials, pattern making, cutting, sewing, finishing, and quality control.<br>

            During the design phase, AGHOR will create sketches or computerized images of the products they want to produce, including the style, color, and materials.<br>
            
            Once the design is finalized, AGHOR will source the necessary materials from suppliers. This could include fabric, buttons, zippers, and other components.<br>
            
            Pattern making is the process of creating a blueprint for the garment or accessory that will guide the cutting and sewing processes.<br>
            
            Next, the materials are cut into the necessary shapes and sizes according to the pattern. This can be done using manual or automated cutting machines.<br>
            
            The sewing process involves stitching the cut pieces together to create the final product. Different machines and techniques are used for different types of stitches and seams.<br>
            
            After the garment or accessory is assembled, it undergoes finishing, which includes tasks such as hemming, adding buttons or zippers, and adding labels or tags.<br>
            
            Finally, the products go through a quality control process to ensure they meet the AGHOR's standards for fit, durability, and overall quality</p>
